He got the government and the public to focus on issues that were relevant to the country's all round growth.He initiated programs like PURA to try and integrate rural areas into the general economic and technological growth of the country. He dreamt of taking the whole of India on his vision for the country in the new millennium, and he saw no reason why the villages should be left out in this vision.",

At a time when the digital world was craving a massive revolution, Apple resorted to a completely different model of creative perfection that proved that the sky is not the limit for the possibilities of engineering marvels. Jobs was a college dropout who had a great time in the counterculture, only to leave all of it to begin Apple Computers with his friend Steve Wozniak in a garage. The rest has been the history that the world has been witnessing ever since.",

Hawking being a brilliant physicist draws a stunningly simple anatomy of intricate nature of the universe through an elegantly written language of physics and mathematics and thus making even a non-scientific person understanding some of the most important aspects of working nature of the cosmos. By stimulating the existential inquisitiveness of the reader, A Brief History of Time not only awakens his interests in physics, cosmology, and particle physics but inspires the natural philosopher and the historian in him. Following the legacy of an elite bunch of people such as Kepler, Copernicus, Einstein and Sagan who brought science of universe to the general public, Hawking successfully attempts in bringing topics of black holes and wormholes to the tables of cafeterias and public media. A Brief History of Time is timeless in its own nature and deserves to be read by anyone who has a curiosity to know the origin and fate of his or her own existence.",

The author argues that an acceptance of mortality should be the center of the way we treat the terminally ill. He compares the attitude towards aging and death in the West and in India and draws on a powerful and moving picture of his father’s final years. Poignant, thought-provoking and deeply moving, Being Mortal is not just about the limits of medicine, but also explores how we should live till the last moment with dignity, independence and joy.",
